## Verdandi - August 2023
> **Challenge**: A simple choice making application using the framework Apache Cordova.

Verdandi is a simple Android application that lets you choose between 2 or more possibilities. If you're inwardly disappointed by the result, that means it's not the right choice. You can click on the regret button that will make another choice for you.

`New update - September 2023:`

- It also lets you choose one of several tasks to do by :
  - Indicating how much free time you have ;
  - Adding the time needed to complete the task (separated by a semicolon) after each task.
- You can also import your own `.txt` file with your choices or tasks. This allows you to have a backup and avoid rewriting everything.

## Message for Myself - November 2022
> **Challenge**: Development of a mobile mood monitoring application.

Message for Myself is a diary in the form of a messaging application. You can send messages and choose the mood of this message. Once sent, your messages are saved. 
Each time you open the application again the conversation field is reset. Nevertheless, if one day you want to remember events or feelings from your past, you can ask (by pressing a button) to receive a old message from yourself by choosing again the mood of the message.

The application is developed on Unity 3D for smartphone. It is also developed on python in a more advanced version, using `Kivy`, `matplotlib` and `google firebase api`, so you can:
- Receive messages from anyone ;
- You can also track your daily mood using a graph.

## Web Images Downloader - July 2022
> **Challenge**: Read manga offline instead of using scans from a web site?

The 'WebImagesDownloader' project allows you to download all the images of a website with distinct characteristics.

### Search and download images:
- Download an image with its link,
- Download an image with its link and check that it is not corrupted,
- Download all the images from a web page by searching in the HTML page url links associated with the 'img' tags.

### Post processing:
- Checks for corrupted images from all images downloaded,
- Converts downloaded images into a .pdf file.

The software tries to automate as much as possible the downloading of images. When the images are on different web pages, it can :
- Use a pattern (given by the user) that repeats in the url links of those images,
- Download images from links of web pages found from a main web page.

However, as each web site is coded differently, it is very difficult to find a universal pattern, that's why the program works according to very specific patterns. The user will have to add a new function dealing with a new pattern if it comes from a web site whose pattern has not been processed.

## Laplacian Edge Detection - January 2022

> **Challenge**: Part of a school project, use the Laplacian formula in Matlab.

Part of a school project, in a group of 4, we decided to use the Laplacian formula to make an edge detection script. It allowed to read an image, apply some filters on it and the Laplacian on each pixel to return only edges of this image. Then, we also conducted an analysis of the script execution time regarding to image sizes. All details are in the report (in French) in the corresponding folder of this repository. An example of our script result is displayed below:
