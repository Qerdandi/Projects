# Textile Packshot Image Creator
This project is part of my 4-month internship as an R&D engineer.
> No details will be divulged for confidentiality reasons. 

## I. Context
The project focuses on digitalizing and automating the process of creating product images, known as packshots. A packshot is a professional-quality image of a product used to promote it and attract consumer attention. It also includes the replacement of mannequins, who are currently contacted to pose with products, with avatars and products 100% digitized.

## II. Objective
- This project will considerably reduce the cost and time involved to create packshots by avoiding the need to plan and coordinate shooting sessions with mannequins.
- The aim of replacing models with avatars is to offer greater flexibility in terms of poses, the number of photos and the organization of scenes. It also allows avatars to be more inclusive and diverse.

## III. The tool
During this internship, I developed this automation tool in Python. The tool enables :
- The user, via a UI, to upload his textile product, fill some information and retrieve the corresponding packshot ;
- To generate an avatar/textile product packshot (set of images) from a 3D textile product ;
- To create a bridge between Clo 3D, Blender 3D softwares and python scripts by using their API through other scripts.

> Clo 3D simulates 3D textiles on an avatar by applying a pose.

> Blender 3D is used to set up the photo shoot scene with different camera angles.

Once the various steps have been completed, the tool generates the final packshot for the user. Here is an example (not final for confidentiality reasons) of a packshot image generated by the tool:

## IV. Additional information
- The number and different camera angles were defined with image team leaders.
- The poses were created on Blender 3D from 3D scans of mannequins, using template fitting.
